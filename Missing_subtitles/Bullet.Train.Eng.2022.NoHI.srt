1
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,634
The boomslang was stolen

2
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:44,729
from the zoo last night.

3
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,388
It's extremely dangerous.

4
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,266
Father.

5
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,847
Any news on my grandson?

6
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,816
No change.

7
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,559
He hasn't woken up.

8
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,734
A father's job is to protect his family.

9
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,067
When Wataru was on that roof...

10
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,488
When he was pushed...

11
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,208
Where was his father?

12
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,166
Wataru is lucky.

13
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:01,717
You never know what horrible fate

14
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,389
your bad luck has saved you from.

15
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,848
♫ <i>stayin' alive, stayin' alive</i> ♫

16
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,391
♫ <i>stayin' alive, stayin' alive...</i> ♫

17
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,100
<i>Thank you for taking the job
on such short notice.</i>

18
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:59,027
I am ready.
You are getting the new and improved me.

19
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,514
Since I've been working with Barry,

20
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:05,239
I am experiencing a calm
like never before. Never.

21
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,239
Like, I'm less reactive to situations,

22
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,090
I'm more accepting of people's shortcomings.

23
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,784
I was a little uncertain about coming
back to work, but it's like Barry says:

24
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,586
You put peace out in the world,
you get peace back.

25
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,583
<i>I think your new therapist might be forgetting</i>

26
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,585
<i>what you do for a living, little ladybug.</i>

27
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,260
- Ladybug?
- <i>Mm-hm. Your new operational name.</i>

28
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,963
- Ladybug? Really?
- <i>You don't like it?</i>

29
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,388
- Do you like it?
- <i>I like it.</i>

30
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,966
Well, if you like it, all right.

31
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,013
Oh, I see what you're doing.
Ladybugs are supposed to be lucky.

32
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,813
Ha, ha,

33
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,608
- <i>you don't have bad luck.</i>
- Really?

34
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:47,531
My bad luck is biblical. I'm not even
trying to kill people and someone dies.

35
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,702
<i>That's an exaggeration.</i>

36
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,575
It is? My last job?

37
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,935
- <i>The political blackmail photos?</i>
- I voted for you.

38
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,451
Remember the suicidal bellboy
climbed the roof of his hotel,

39
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,876
<i>couldn't take it anymore?</i>

40
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,925
<i>Seems more like his bad luck than yours.</i>

41
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:06,674
Hang in there, buddy!

42
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,255
<i>And he didn't die.</i>

43
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,637
<i>Okay? You drove him to the hospital.
It's good luck.</i>

44
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,513
- <i>All in how you frame it.</i>
- Sure.

45
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,145
Gotta say I like it here.
I could live here.

46
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,808
I like the atmosphere,
the people are considerate...

47
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,649
Except for that guy.

48
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,441
Why is this job paying so well?

49
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,991
<i>It was supposed to be Carver's,
but he's got some stomach thing.</i>

50
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,785
- Carver?
- <i>And he doesn't do snatch-and-grabs.</i>

51
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,249
I'm filling in for Carver?
You picked me second to Carver?

52
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,667
<i>You said you wanted simple
for your first job back.</i>

53
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,960
<i>Doesn't get simpler.</i>

54
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,000
- Shit.
- <i>Shit what?</i>

55
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,531
I think I must have lost the key
when that guy bumped into me.

56
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,793
- What's the number again?
- <i>523.</i>

57
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:54,972
Carver.

58
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,553
What an ego.

59
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,103
I mean, talk about
a candidate for self-improvement.

60
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,605
Calling in sick?
I mean, what is that, high school?

61
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,528
<i>Mm. I can hear that personal growth.</i>

62
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,323
I know I'm being judgmental.
I need to work on that.

63
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,651
But, Jesus, what a douchebag.

64
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,282
<i>You have the strangest requests.
Firecrackers?</i>

65
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,454
I'm industrious.

66
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,493
<i>Please tell me
you didn't order the sleeping powder.</i>

67
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:19,418
Nope.

68
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,824
<i>You almost gave that bodyguard
in Anchorage a heart attack.</i>

69
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,296
I've worked on the dosage.

70
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,050
<i>Take the gun.</i>

71
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,264
Ticket please.

72
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,352
Thank you for using our train.

73
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,899
First class is that way.

74
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,875
<i>I'll assume you didn't take the gun?</i>

75
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,022
Barry says every conflict

76
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,824
is an opportunity for a peaceful...
What was it?

77
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,653
<i>And your handler says
some conflicts require a gun.</i>

78
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,747
Shit.

79
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,128
Okay, I'm on.

80
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,376
<i>Well, that's a start.</i>

81
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,171
Hey, this is nice.

82
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,261
Economy?

83
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:13,051
I'm thinking of starting my own agency.
You know, all simple jobs, all the time.

84
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,597
<i>That's a terrible business plan.</i>

85
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,518
No more sociopaths, no more maniacs.
Just quality people.

86
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,142
Barry says it's time for some change.
I think he's right.

87
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,348
<i>Barry does not know what you do for a living.</i>

88
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,901
<i>Okay, here we go.
The bullet train has 16 cars.</i>

89
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,944
<i>Ten economy, six first-class,</i>

90
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,443
<i>and remember,
only one minute stop at every station.</i>

91
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,742
Bloody fuckin' Hell. Do you mind?

92
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,826
What is he, fucking blind or something?

93
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,873
Come on. No, you don't
have to Nick the biscuits, man.

94
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,668
Oh, no. You all right? Okay, cool.

95
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,174
- Fucking asshole.
- Thank you.

96
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,638
Why'd I do that?

97
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,598
It's like I got a compulsion or something.
I have to take it if I see it.

98
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,560
Need to talk to someone. Serious.

99
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,480
A goldfish biscuit?
I mean, I don't understand it.

100
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:07,150
Okay, simple snatch-and-grab.
What am I snatching and/or grabbing?

101
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,650
<i>A briefcase. Intel says
there's a train sticker on the handle.</i>

102
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,573
Briefcases have owners.
Owners are not simple.

103
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,322
<i>And the last update says
the owners will be in economy class.</i>

104
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,826
Owners, plural?
Why didn't you tell me to bring that gun?

105
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,248
<i>I did.
You chose spiritual enlightenment.</i>

106
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,792
<i>Chiketto,</i> please.

107
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,879
Ticket.

108
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,464
Hold on.

109
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,131
Ah, no, no. Receipt.

110
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,674
Oh. Uh...

111
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,386
Shit, I think I dropped my ticket, too.

112
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,679
Uh, that receipt shows
I bought a ticket, though, right?

113
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:43,939
One stop.

114
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:45,816
Yep.

115
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,674
I thought they bowed here.

116
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,624
I pushed him. First class, seat b4

117
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,650
Sorry, kid.
I'm looking for...

118
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,450
You found her.

119
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,490
- Oh, Lemon.
- Tangerine.

120
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,699
You're bleeding, mate.

121
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,286
Oh, mate, shit. Oh, shit, man.

122
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,379
Who the fuck did I kill?

123
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,503
- Get a wet one on it or something.
- It's not mine, mate.

124
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,171
- Oh, it's not yours?
- Yeah. I don't bleed.

125
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,799
In that case, leave your jacket open,
let everyone have a good old look.

126
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,301
- Yeah, I want everyone to see my tie.
- Fuck is wrong with you?

127
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,426
Pull your coat together
so no one else notices, Lemon.

128
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,716
I think they'll notice
the childish code names first.

129
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,473
But if we're gonna stick with fruit,
why not, uh, apple or orange?

130
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,562
So, what's in this case?

131
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,060
<i>Are we doing this?</i>

132
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,811
<i>You know what's in the case.</i>

133
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,643
Money. It's always money.

134
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,523
Tangerines are sophisticated.

135
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,174
Now he's callin' a fruit sophisticated.

136
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,987
Yeah, it's cross-hybridized with other fruit.

137
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,529
They're adaptable. Like me.

138
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,612
You said six cars in economy,

139
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,539
say 30 passengers per car,

140
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,460
guessing two bags per,
let's see, uh, times two and you carry...

141
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,209
Yeah, no fuckin' way I'm gonna find one brie...

142
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,175
- Wait.
- <i>What?</i>

143
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,714
- Train sticker on the handle?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

144
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,175
Holy shitbox.

145
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,661
- And why am I Lemon?
- Because you're sour.

146
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,525
- No one likes lemons.
- That's bollocks, mate.

147
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,603
lemonades, Lemon Drops.

148
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,268
- You got a sore throat?
- Lemon meringue pie.

149
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,514
When's the last time
you ate a lemon meringue pie?

150
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,128
- Lemon drizzle cake.
- I'm sorry, are you talking about lemons?

151
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,686
- I have the case.
<i>- Well, that's great.</i>

152
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,111
- Is it?
- <i>Yes.</i>

153
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,984
- What's the catch?
- <i>There is a no catch.</i>

154
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,407
- There's always a catch.
- <i>Get off the train.</i>

155
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,112
Quite like lemons. I just hate code names.

156
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,450
Oh, well, look at this. Sleeping beauty.

157
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,703
- Wakey, wakey.
- Eggs and bakey.

158
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:15,966
Where am I?

159
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,261
You're safe now. Your father sent us.

160
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,259
You idiots work for my father?

161
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,345
Ooh, easy, we could deliver you
back to your pops in a box.

162
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,398
Technically, we're outside contractors.

163
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,143
I'm Tangerine. He's Lemon.

164
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,144
Like the fruit?

165
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,904
- You ever watch <i>Thomas the tank engine?</i>
- Here we go.

166
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,953
Hey, you watch something nowadays,
what is it, huh? Nothing.

167
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,031
It's twists, violence, drama, no message.

168
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,287
What's the point? Huh?

169
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,118
What are we supposed to learn?

170
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,422
Everything I learned about people
I learned from Thomas.

171

Take Tangerine here.
He's 3 Gordon. This blue one.

173
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,471
And Gordon is the strongest, the most important.

174
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,469
But he doesn't always listen to others.

Wise, kind.

- Oh, it's sophisticated, mate.

Oh, fuckin' Hell.
It's not important, is it?

191
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,558

193

Where this woman found herself

00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,287
in the unfortunate position
of owing your father a tidy sum of money.

256
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:27,045
Now, the issue was it took her
some time to acquire this money.

257
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,297
But she did pay it back
five minutes late, didn't she?

258
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,299
- Yeah, what'd he do?
- Cut her arm off.

259
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,505
- Fuckin' Hell!
- Yeah.

260
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,479
He said she owed him a finger for every minute.

261
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,559
He's not a monster. He didn't
make her sit through it five times.

He just out once, didn't he?

282
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,808

00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,027
<i>And those loyal to him said:</i>

343
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,201
<i>"Hold your horses."
This geezer ain't the full ticket.</i>

344
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,903
<i>"He ain't to be trusted."</i>

345
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,238
<i>"He's dangerous," they said.</i>

346
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,416
<i>"A modern plague," they said.</i>

347
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,584
<i>"A White Death."</i>

348
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,416
<i>So, sure enough, they were right.</i>

349
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,461
<i>He made his own alliance.</i>

350
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,172
<i>His own gang.</i>

351
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,726
<i>And what'd he do?</i>

352
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,303
Stabbed him in the back.

353
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,457
I mean, metaphorically.
He blew his fucking brains out, didn't he?

354
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,701
<i>He wiped the name Minegishi off
the face of the earth in one single night.</i>

355
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,742
<i>And made an empire worthy of the White Death.</i>

356
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,667
So, let me put this bluntly.

357
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,593
There's this soulless psychotic leader

358
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,421
with the largest criminal organization
on the planet

359
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,724
shoved right inside our fucking ass cheeks.

360
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,852
That motherfucker's definitely 
a diesel, then, isn't he?

361
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,098
If you mention Thomas the tank engine
one more time

362
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:20,481
- I'm gonna shoot you in the fucking face.
- Okay, if he's such a badass,

363
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,277
how come he hired two random operators
instead of getting his son back himself?

364
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,529
If you actually read the briefings
you'd know that he had a wife.

365
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,649
What, he had a wife?

366
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,452
She was the most important
fucking thing in his life, and she died.

367
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,978
Drunk driving accident or some shit.

368
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,250
And now he's at the compound.
He ain't left since.

369
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,583
An unnamed locomotive might 
say there's a lesson to be learned.

370
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,125
And he didn't hire two random operators, Lemon.

371
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,297
No, he asked for the best.

372
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,670
He asked for the two responsible
for the Bolivia job.

373
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,642
He asked for pros who wouldn't fuck up.

374
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,344
Three words, Lemon.

375
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,769
- We are...
- Fucked.

376
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,855
What do you want?

377
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,483
People think that I'm just some young girl.

378
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,866
Someone's future wife...

379
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,115
Or future mother.

380
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,497
But I'm not in someone else's story.

381
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,039
You're all in mine.

382
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,205
The fuck does that have to do with me?

383
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,917
You work for the most feared boss
in the city: The White Death.

384
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,212
Oh, deny it all you want.

385
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,719
But you work for someone who works
for someone else, et cetera, et cetera,

386
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,347
and it all falls under the same person.

387
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,974
You delivered a briefcase two days ago

388
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,602
<i>to one of the White Death's associates,</i>

389
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,183
and I saw my opportunity.

390
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,979
<i>Follow the case and find the White Death.</i>

391
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,280
I don't know what you think I can do for you.

392
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,984
Oh, that is my favorite part of the story.

393
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,989
You're going to kill him for me.

394
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:58,412
How the fuck am I going to kill the White Death?

395
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,159
You'll see.

396
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,625
Oh, look at that.

397
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,457
We are right on schedule.

398
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,798
Sit back, relax a little bit.
You look so tense.

399
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:26,065
We rescued his fucking son. Huh?

400
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,988
We find the fucker who took the briefcase,
make things right,

401
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,815
be like it never happened.

402
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,496
You still got that vest on ya?

403
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,868
No, vests give you a false sense of security.

404
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,626
You might, like, get shot in the neck.

405
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,713
It also stops you from getting shot in the chest,

406
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,710
but I guess you missed that episode of <i>Thomas.</i>

407
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,343
I really must've,
because that sounds dark as shit.

408
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,629
Nut up or shut up, bruv.

409
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,675
♫ <i>I'm forever blowing bubbles</i> ♫

410
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,017
♫ <i>pretty bubbles in the air</i> ♫

411
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,773
♫ <i>they fly so high
they nearly reach the sky...</i> ♫

412
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,446
Well, so, slight change of plans.

413
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,523
Oh!

414
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,449
First his wife, now his son?

415
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,834
That's a lot of White Deaths.

416
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,805
I want you to be strong, son.
Do you understand?

417
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,390
Be strong.

418
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:37,512
My heart.

419
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,290
No!

420
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:27,852
Find me the son of a bitch who did this.

421
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,280
You lucky son of a bitch.

422
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,580
You stabbed me?!

423
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,582
- You ruined my life.
- I don't even know you!

424
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,509
I come here for revenge.

425
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,465
The assassin who killed El Saguaro
killed my wife.

426
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,259
But fate made this a two for one special.

427
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:03,068
Can we just take a time-out here?
Talk this out?

428
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,886
I will never stop coming for you.

429
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,025
What?

430
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,702
Run as far as you like.
I will find you.

431
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:09,654
Why?

432
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,991
And I will ruin your life
the way you ruined mine!

433
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,621
Dude, I don't even know you!

434
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,316
My heart.

435
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,577
What the...?

436
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,158
Wow. Really?

437
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:57,577
Let this be a lesson in the toxicity of anger.

438
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:04,000
Venezuela, Uruguay, Barcelona.

439
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,422
Who are you?

440
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,228
Mmm!

441
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,952
<i>All passengers: We'll make a brief stop</i>

442
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,233
- at <i>Shin Yokohama.</i>
- All right, mate, try these.

443
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,669
- They're them Momonga glasses.
- The fuck is a Momonga?

444
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,088
Comes on after Thomas every Thursday.

445
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,845
- Okay.
- It's good.

446
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,803
- Just like that.
- He should look asleep. There, like that.

447
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:01,901
Ah!

448
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,228
Mmm!

449
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,734
Wasabi.

450
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,232
We gotta make sure he doesn't 
step a foot off this train.

451
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,702
You see the case, deal with whoever has it.

452
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,123
All right, how do I do that?
Talk to him, or, like, talk to him?

453
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,542
Why don't you tell him about the
story about how Gordon met Percy

454
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,291
and how Percy's now bleeding
from his fucking eye sockets!

455
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,166
He means kill him.

456
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,591
<i>All passengers:</i>

457
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:32,464
<i>We'll make a brief stop at shin Yokohama.</i>
Goddamn it.

458
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,770
Excuse me.

459
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,352
You are fuckin' excused.

460
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,192
<i>Arigato.</i>

461
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,510
Joburg.

462
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:21,520
I'm sorry, buddy.

463
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:23,983
Give it!

464
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,521
Shitballs!

465
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,232
That wasn't a minute.

466
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,664
- I missed my stop.
<i>- Why?</i>

467
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,965
- Because God hates me.
- <i>No, she doesn't.</i>

468
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,966
- <i>Do you still have the case?</i>
- Yeah, I stashed it.

469
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,884
- <i>Get off at the next stop.</i>
- It sounds so easy when you say it.

470
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,894
Does the name El Cigarillo mean anything to you?

471
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,565
- <i>El Saguaro? The cartel boss?</i>
- Yeah, why does that sound so familiar?

472
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,571
<i>He was in the wedding you infiltrated in Mexico.</i>

473
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,983
- Tequila?
- <i>You were the cocktail server.</i>

474
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:17,489
The groom.
I knew I recognized that guy.

475
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,695
- I'm really good with faces.
- <i>Wait, what guy?</i>

476
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,206
Sorry. Be right back.

477
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,664
The guy who stabbed me.
I spilled wine on his suit. He's dead now.

478
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,081
- <i>You killed The Wolf?</i>
- It was an accident.

479
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:30,540
I'm really gonna have to process
my part in the incident on Monday.

480
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,716
Shit! Fuck! No.

481
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,134
<i>Shit. Fuck. What?</i>

482
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,719
Remember those two wackos from the
Bolivia job killed all those people?

483
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,216
- <i>The Twins?</i>
- Yeah, I'm not so sure they're twins.

484
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,142
<i>Stop it. Everyone knows they're twins.</i>

485
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,266
One of them is walking towards me right now.

486
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,728
I think I saw the other one on the platform.

487
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,564
Occupied.

488
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,371
<i>Now we know who the owners of the case are.</i>

489
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,899
This is exactly what I'm talkin' about.

490
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,859
We have to have a hard discussion
about the caliber of people

491
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,264
- we are surrounding ourselves with.
- <i>Why are we whispering?</i>

492
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:02,827
- Hello.
<i>- The White Death would like to know</i>

493
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,952
- <i>why you stepped off train.</i>
- Wanted some fresh air.

494
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,747
<i>Your orders were to stay on the train.</i>

495
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,920
I didn't realize I was gettin'
a babysitter to come cut my bollocks.

496
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,625
I'm a professional. We're making sure
the case and his son are perfectly safe.

497
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,592
- Can I please go do my job now?
- If something is go wrong...

498
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,588
Oh, very kind of you.
Thank you very much.

499
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:27,976
Fuck me! Jesus Christ.

500
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,024
It's very rude, talking on the phone,
on the train in Japan.

501
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,193
This rude enough for ya, ya fucking prick?

502
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,238
Shove that fuckin' hat up 
your fuckin' asshole, you hear me?

503
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,911
Fuck this job.

504
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,078
I knew we should have got an upgrade, fuck all.

505
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,700
I beg your pardon, sorry.

506
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,740
I wasn't aware there was a young lady present. 
Apologize.

507
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,758
You didn't happen to see someone come by
with a silver briefcase, did ya?

508
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,640
There's a little train sticker by the handle.

509
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,545
Actually, yeah.

510
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,924
A man with black framed glasses had it.
He went that way.

511
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:04,935
Thank you, love.

512
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,554
That fucking bastard.

513
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,645
Come on.

514
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:19,486
"Guy in black glasses. Stop him."

515
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,660
- Hi. There's a gun under this table...
- Shh.

516
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:28,457
This is the quiet car. Gotta use
your small inside voice in here, son.

517
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:34,539
There's a gun underneath this table
pointed right at you, so I would...

518
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,993
- I can't really hear what you're saying.
- There's a gun...

519
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,798
I'm just fuckin' with you, mate.

520
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,181
It's been a long time since Johannesburg.

521
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,434
Yeah. Who the fuck are you?

522
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,137
Really. You don't remember me?

523
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,562
You look like every white 
homeless man I've ever seen.

524
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,236
Okay.

525
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,646
Well, I have something
I believe you're looking f...

526
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,278
- Really? You don't remember me?
- I remember Johannesburg,

527
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,110
- but I don't remember you.
- You shot me.

528
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,661
- I shoot a lot of people.
- You shot me twice.

529
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:08,666
Ow!

530
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,459
Well, you also have a shootable face.

531
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,668
I know you're black framed glasses.

532
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,165
The cheeky fucker who took our briefcase.

533
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,425
Yes. Yes, I am.

534
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,512
Hm.

535
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,880
You know, I've done a lot
of personal work since Joburg.

536
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,806
I've forgiven, I've moved on.

537
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,726
I've learned that with any potential conflict

538
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:32,976
there's an opportunity for growth,
a path to a peaceful outcome.

539
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,149
Interesting.

540
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,236
Who is that?

541
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,190
I have no idea.

542
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,539
How did you know that was there?

543
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:53,669
Didn't I mention?

544
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,623
I've always been lucky.

545
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,547
It was then that I took
a long, hard look into the mirror.

546
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,138
And you know what?

547
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,172
Buddy, I didn't like what I saw.

548
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,432
Nope. <i>Nada.</i>

549
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:09,518
Hm.

550
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,436
- Until I did. You know?
- Mm.

551
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,567
- Between us now sits a wall.
- Mm-hm.

552
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,104
But it's an illusion.

553
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:26,700
For within every wall, uh, awaits a window...

554
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,035
Oh, wait, it's a door.

555
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:32,160
Real quick, um, every day is a
fucking headache with you, innit?

556
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,042
Right. You and your partner...

557
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,460
I'm Lemon, he's Tangerine.

558
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,378
Okay, Lemon... like the fruit?

559
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,047
Blessings.

560
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,632
Mm.

561
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,399
- What's your plan here?
- Here's the plan.

562
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,838
I give you back your case, you don't kill me.

563
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,639
You give your case to your employer,
he doesn't kill you.

564
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,768
You're alive, I'm alive, everyone's happy.

565
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:53,935
Win-win, don't you think?

566
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:57,686
How do you know whoever hired you
won't kill you for failing your job?

567
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,392
Lose-lose. No happy.

568
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:00,966
Man, I just wanna get off this train,

569
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,566
go see a Zen garden and some shit, you know?

570
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,695
- I'd like to accept your offer.
- Great.

571
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,027
But then you went and killed someone.
Didn't you?

572
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,374
- How did you know...?
- Wasn't exactly subtle.

573
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,705
It was an accident. Tragic.

574
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,835
Bizarre, even.

575
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,792
Cool story, bro,

576
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:27,425
but I think you had your own plans
of getting out of here with that case.

577
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,467
- No, no.
- Pinning a body on us.

578
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,467
Hoping the White Death

579
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,014
is so busy cuttin' off our arms
instead of cuttin' off our fingers.

580
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,387
It's like Thomas the tank engine
always says: "Simple is better."

581
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,321
- The kids' show?
- Yes, the fucking ki... man.

582
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,647
I learned everything about people from Thomas.

583
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:41,858
Everything.
Really?

584
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:43,982
It's how I can read people like you so well.

585
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,609
- And you are a diesel.
- I am not a diesel.

586
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,861
- You're the diesel-est diesel...
- Not even close.

587
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,693
I've ever seen in my life, man.

588
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:52,869
'Cause diesels bluff. They go too far.

589
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,956
I'm trying to get diesels
out of my life, you know?

590
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,913
If there was a gun under this table, yeah,
I'd be as dead as that kid over there.

591
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,296
Hm?

592
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,776
- Uh-uh.
- Mm-hm.

593
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:27,406
Nope.

594
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:34,153
You mother...

595
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,909
Have the courage to listen.

596
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,302
Come on, Joburg.

597
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:00,898
No.

598
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,772
Shot number three.

599
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:19,285
No, no, no. I ain't got the time
or the Patience, let alone the interest.

600
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,666
Fucking Hell.

601
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,248
Are you following me? Stop!

602
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,339
&$♫%♫

603
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,710
- Asshole!
- Ow!

604
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,399
Shh! I'll call the conductor!

605
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,404
Eat a bag of dicks, lady!

606
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,776
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm working on it.

607
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,101
I'm not a diesel, you're a diesel.

608
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,382
- Ow!
- Shh!

609
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,884
- There's another body here.
- Of course there is.

610
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,467
Not my fault, and I believe
it's the son of the White Death.

611
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:02,561
<i>Did the twins ID you?</i>

612
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,685
Did you hear what I said?
White Death. Death. Death.

613
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,438
Snatch-and-grab, my ass.

614
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,857
There's someone else doing a job on this train.

615
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,275
<i>The Twins. We know that.</i>

616
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,898
Again, not twins.

617
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,855
Loonies, but not twins.

618
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:19,568
They're here for the kid,
but somebody killed the kid.

619
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,490
- The guy with the knife.
- <i>The Wolf.</i>

620
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,502
He said he came here for revenge.

621
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:32,502
He just happened to run into me,
because of course he did.

622
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,087
Now, get this.

623
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:39,384
The kid was poisoned in the same way
as El Sabarro was at the wedding.

624
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,056
<i>It's El Saguaro.</i>

625
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:42,507
- <i>The same killer?</i>
- Yeah.

626
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,265
I'm like MacGyver.

627
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:50,317
Fuck!

628
00:42:56,491 --> 00:43:00,906
All of Japan is in terror
because a poisonous snake was stolen.

629
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:05,330
Boomslang snakes have a very strong poison.

630
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,033
When they bite, it can cause internal bleeding...

631
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,459
And bleeding from holes in the body.

632
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,752
Oh, shit.

633
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,045
<i>What are you doing?</i>

634
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,007
<i>What's wrong?</i>

635
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,209
Fuck this, man.

636
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:19,294
Fuck Carver.

637
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,302
Shit.

638
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,718
Oh, thank God. For a minute there...

639
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:28,975
Jesus Christ, you had a bit of a bosh, pal.

640
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,399
All right. Five stations to Kyoto.

641
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:35,359
Better get tickety-boo.

642
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,908
Would you describe me as 
someone who lives in perpetual anxiety?

643
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,029
<i>No, no.</i>

644
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,121
Ah, fucknuts.

645
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:45,912
<i>And if it wasn't clear, I meant "yes."</i>

646
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,118
- The conductor, I don't have a ticket.
- <i>Not sure that's your biggest concern.</i>

647
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,249
You don't understand, this 
guy's like criss-fuckin'-angel.

648
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,744
He pops up everywhere.

649
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,797
He slows me down,
Tangerine catches me, I am dead.

650
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,003
Dead. Dead.

651
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:00,971
Hold on.

652
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,800
Hey, bro.

653
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,390
Wanna make an easy 200 bucks?

654
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,151
Is this like a... sex thing?

655
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,325
Nope.

656
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,359
Oh, okay. I was kidding.

657
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,133
Uh, yeah, what's up?
What do you need, bro?

658
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,120
All right, game's up, big boy.

659
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,197
Where is the case?

660
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:14,209
Tell me, and I promise
I'll only shoot you enough...

661
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:17,538
Whoa, whoa, um, is this the sex stuff?

662
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,087
Twat!

663
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:25,512
- Shit.
- I do love an accent.

664
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:33,720
Come on.

665
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,153
Oops.

666
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:45,945
Picture it.

667
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,950
Picture what?

668
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:50,199
Well, the man. Watching your son.

669
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,201
<i>I wonder how he'll do it.</i>

670
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,202
Maybe a pillow to the face.

671
00:45:57,797 --> 00:45:59,413
Or maybe something clever.

672
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:02,173
Like an air bubble in the iv.

673
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,010
No, no. You hold onto it.

674
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,960
The innocent young girl act
doesn't really get you very far

675
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,633
if you're holding a loaded gun.

676
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,148
Put it on speaker.

677
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,685
- Father.
- Yuichi?

678
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,943
Why did you leave the hospital?

679
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:28,983
Be honest.

680
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,657
Who's there with you?

681
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:37,580
I found out who pushed Wataru off that roof.

682
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:40,128
Did you go to the authorities?

683
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,921
I wanted to handle it myself.

684
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,006
My son.

685
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:51,260
You can't control what fate has in store for us.

686
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:52,851
Father.

687
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,020
I'm sorry.

688
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,188
We're not finished.

689
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:02,984
You're going to sit here and you're going
to go through every combination

690
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,652
until you open up that case.

691
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:07,857
- Kid, that could take f...
- No, no. It won't.

692
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:10,908
I'd start with the low numbers.
Just a thought.

693
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,134
Fuck me!

694
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,630
- There he is.
- He got by me.

695
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,340
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

696
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:36,551
I guess our best option now

697
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:39,307
is, uh, bring the White Death
the man who killed his son.

698
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,479
- But glasses didn't do it.
- I could give a rat's ass.

699
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:43,439
No, I'm telling you, I read him.
He's not the type, mate.

700
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,124
I'll tell you what, do you like your arms?

701
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,442
- You know I like my arms.
- Well, then

702
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,438
someone's got to take the blame, don't they?

703
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,154
- That's you or me?
- You or me?

704
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:56,120
Shit, that asshole stole my phone.

705
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,242
And my gun, Lucille.

706
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,540
- Oh, come on.
- That's my favorite gun. Son of a bitch.

707
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:00,627
Fuck about.

708
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,002
- Right, what?
<i>- Step off the train at the next stop</i>

709
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,545
- <i>with the briefcase and the son.</i>
- Hang on a minute, didn't we say Kyoto?

710
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,915
<i>You will still depart at Kyoto.</i>

711
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,758
<i>The White Death wants to make sure
you are being honest about situation.</i>

712
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:12,523
Well, this is a complete waste of our t...

713
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:16,808
All right, all right. We just have
to prove we have a case we don't have

714
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,056
and a live son instead of a dead one.

715
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:21,809
What are you thinking?

716
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:25,526
- The ol' Punch and Judy?
- The ol' punch and Judy.

717
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:10,149
You were all told to exit the train.

718
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:12,981
Yeah? Well, unlike you,
I'm a professional.

719
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,715
I wanted to make sure it weren't
some Yakuza trap, but clearly not.

720
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,652
It's some fuckin' '80s dance-off, innit?

721
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:21,156
Where is your twin? Tangerine?

722
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,250
I'm Tangerine.

723
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,579
Lemon's keepin' the case safe.

724
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:25,831
And the White Death's son?

725
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,246
Yeah, he's there.

726
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,671
Wave to your fuckin' fans, Princess.

727
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,383
He's a fuckin' happy chappy, isn't he?

728
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:39,887
But, uh, I've gotta pop on the train,
you know, ten seconds left, so ta-ra.

729
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,557
We'll stick to the plan, depart in Kyoto.

730
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:47,060
Do us a favor:
Get the fuck off my back, will ya?

731
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:57,452
Okay.

732
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,323
Okay.

733
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,575
Whoa!

734
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:05,919
Okay.

735
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:08,922
Okay.

736
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,549
- That couldn't have gone better.
- Yeah, let's hope they buy it.

737
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:16,719
We need to find that glasses twat,
like, right to the fuck now.

738
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:21,257
I'm gonna go up, you go down,
double back when you're done.

739
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,138
If you see him, fucking deal with him, yeah?

740
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,469
Yeah.

741
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,060
- Up is...?
- That way. Towards Tokyo.

742
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,892
Departing trains are always moving down.

743
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,192
And, look, be careful.

744
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:34,862
- Something else is going on here.
- Yeah?

745
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,316
Yeah, I still feel like
there's a diesel lurking about.

746
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:41,153
I swear to God! 
What did I say? What did I say?

747
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:43,784
- I said I'll fucking...
- Shoot me in the face. Yeah.

748
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,411
Thomas still taught me how to see people,
read them for real.

749
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:47,742
Yeah.

750
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,747
- And I'm never wrong, am I?
- No.

751
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,829
Glasses, he is not our guy.

752
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,210
Okay.

753
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:00,679
You shoot first and come 
up with the answers later.

754
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,187
I always do.

755
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:10,189
And, Lemon?

756
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:11,899
Yeah, man?

757
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:14,602
You be careful, too.

758
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:21,489
I mean, when this train's a-rockin'
don't come a-knockin', right?

759
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,910
Seven more minutes and I am off this train.

760
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:13,564
<i>Are you hiding in the bathroom?</i>

761
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:16,502
Yeah. Have you tried these smart toilets?

762
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:19,050
They're a pleasure to the senses.

763
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:22,883
If I had one in the chamber
I would rock this bad boy right now.

764
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,010
<i>Boundaries. We need boundaries.</i>

765
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:33,647
Holy shit.

766
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:39,191
Holy shit.

767
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,161
Whoa there.

768
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,369
Oh, look at that.

769
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,792
I knew my luck would rub off on you.

770
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:56,833
Fuck.

771
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,349
What the fuck are you doing?

772
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:13,179
I am doing the same thing
that I did to the gun in your hand.

773
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,811
I'm just making things interesting.

774
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,646
I'm hedging my bets, you could say.

775
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,901
Fuck.

776
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,608
If the gun doesn't kill him, the case will.

777
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:28,115
This thing could have blown 
up in my hand at any point.

778
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:31,997
No, no. It's inert unless you fire it.

779
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,617
But don't fire it, you know what I mean?

780
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:39,296
Unlike what I put in this briefcase here.
This is very...

781
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,718
Well, this is not inert at all.
This is...

782
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:51,221
Did you know that there have been
31 attempts on the White Death's life

783
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,177
from within his own organization?

784
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:57,224
Each one, he executed with their own weapon.

785
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,192
Do you see what I'm getting at here?

786
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,858
Kimura, I brought you here to fail.

787
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,941
You push my son off a roof...

788
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,072
- Right.
- Bring me to this train...

789
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,662
Frame me as an assassin

790
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:15,324
here to kill the White Death, and use my gun...

791
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,498
That will blow up in his face?

792
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,000
Very good.

793
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,498
Very, very good.

794
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,379
It's a stupid plan.

795
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,381
It is...

796
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,221
A brilliant plan.

797
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,021
Occupied.

798
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:42,231
<i>You remember that mob surgeon
that died mid-heart operation?</i>

799
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:45,901
- Yeah, he had a stroke, right?
- <i>No, that was the official cover.</i>

800
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,699
<i>He was poisoned. The assassin
goes by the name of The Hornet.</i>

801
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:51,198
Oh, my God!

802
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,740
<i>He used boomslang snake venom.</i>

803
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:59,122
<i>It congeals the blood, making 
you bleed out of every orifice.</i>

804
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:02,251
<i>If the antidote isn't administered
within 30 seconds, you're dead.</i>

805
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,708
<i>Fun fact: The same poison that was used on...</i>

806
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:06,803
El Sagardo.

807
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:09,508
<i>It's El Saguaro.</i>

808
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:11,760
What is The Hornet doing on this train?

809
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:15,388
<i>Well, whatever deal was made, it wasn't
done through the normal channels.</i>

810
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:17,015
<i>There's something else going on here.</i>

811
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,708
How long are you going to be?

812
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,938
It's still occupied, lady.

813
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:23,400
&$#%*

814
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,447
The Wolf must have figured out who The Hornet is,

815
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:29,115
came here for revenge for his wife,
his boss, came here to whack The Hornet.

816
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:30,817
<i>Oh, my God, did you just say "whack"?</i>

817
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:33,551
- I did, I'm bringing it back.
- <i>No, it needs to stay where it was.</i>

818
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,100
If I can figure out who The Hornet is,

819
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,907
I can give him to Lemon and Tangerine
so they don't whack me.

820
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,117
- <i>Really?</i>
- You see what I did there?

821
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:41,959
<i>You're really proud of yourself, aren't you?</i>

822
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:45,298
Jeez, they're usually so polite here.

823
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:47,341
Lady, I'm so...

824
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,345
Oh. That's cool.

825
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,309
Bastard!

826
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:01,181
Come here, you dirty fucking scum!

827
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,714
Wait, wait, wait.
I know who killed the kid.

828
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,463
I couldn't give a rat's ass.
Where's my fucking case?

829
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,525
Yeah.

830
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,072
Oh.

831
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,780
Oh, I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

832
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:07,088
Oh, no, thank you. We're okay.

833
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:10,007
Oh, I would love a bottle of water.

834
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:16,930
You know what? Do you have
anything sparkling? With bubbles?

835
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,766
That's the one. Thank...

836
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:25,519
Yeah.

837
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:26,609
Oh, yeah.

838
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:32,238
Bro, I just remembered I gave all my money
to that guy to wear my hat and glasses.

839
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:33,655
Could you?

840
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,365
How much for the bottle of water, love?

841
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,917
Ah!

842
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,671
Oh, there. No, you're welcome. Yeah.

843
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:52,041
A thousand yen. That's ten quid
for that bottle of water, mate.

844
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,341
Mmm.

845
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,007
Ta-ra.

846
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,375
You sure you don't wanna talk this out?

847
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,106
Not particularly, no.

848
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,273
Okay.

849
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:15,107
You fucking bastard! Fucker! 
Come here, you little fuck!

850
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,040
I know who killed the kid.

851
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:30,997
Yeah? Where the fuck is he, then?

852
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,540
He's on this train.

853
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,592
Well, that narrows it down, then, don't it?

854
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:42,387
Let go! Get off!

855
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:11,881
You gonna get that?

856
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:13,883
No.

857
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:16,588
You probably oughta get that.

858
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,506
It could be important.

859
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:27,144
Okay, maybe it's important.

860
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,141
Fucking Hell. Come here.

861
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,570
Yeah, what do you want?

862
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:34,232
<i>The White Death says to get off
at next stop holding the briefcase</i>

863
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,978
<i>or he will kill everyone on that train.</i>

864
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:39,862
Okay, yeah, I can make it, but Lemon,
he's a little tied up right now.

865
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:44,077
<i>Both of you this time. With the case.
Or everyone dies.</i>

866
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:48,324
Fuckin' paranoid, this lot.

867
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,998
You don't happen to have the case on you, do ya?

868
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,084
No.

869
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:55,797
Yeah, I don't think I'd 
reach Lemon in time anyway.

870
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:57,583
You still got his phone.

871
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,342
Do you have a gun on ya?

872
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:04,181
- Don't like 'em.
- Well...

873
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,134
Game's up, mate.

874
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:09,561
For what it's worth,
you seem like a right fucking asshole

875
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,730
and I'm glad you're gonna fucking die with me.

876
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:12,852
That's nice.

877
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,444
- Just curious.
- Yeah?

878
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,981
Do they even know what Lemon looks like?

879
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,815
Wow.

880
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:25,239
You two do look like twins, huh?

881
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:29,536
Yeah, okay. We got the case, now what?

882
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,084
You still take the train to Kyoto station.

883
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:35,875
Mm-hm. Yeah. Okay.
We can do that. Wonderful.

884
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:36,966
Hey.

885
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:40,251
- Have you opened the case?
- No, of course not.

886
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,545
I never asked for the combination,
you know what I mean?

887
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:43,671
Keep it safe that way.

888
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:45,085
Yeah.

889
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:46,758
So no one gets greedy.

890
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:07,782
I know, I know.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

891
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:10,456
- I have this bad luck thing.
- Is that what you call it?

892
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:11,907
I hit the thing and it went:

893
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:15,415
- Why did you even bother trying?
- I was trying to sell it.

894
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,002
Well, I don't think they were in the market

895
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,294
for fucking dildos and pantyhose, were they?

896
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,966
But they were buying it.

897
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:22,970
I had 'em.

898
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,765
You proved you're smarter
than everyone. You've won, kid.

899
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:30,686
Please.

900
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,637
Please, kid.

901
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,108
Call your man.

902
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:39,188
I'll do what you want.

903
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,441
Just leave my son alone.

904
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,034
Your son.

905
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:49,946
Do you know how easy it was to get 
him to follow me up onto that roof?

906
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,162
Didn't think it would take you three hours

907
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:57,870
to even realize your son was missing.

908
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,130
You're a terrible father,

909
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:02,709
and your son is going to pay

910
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,759
for all the mistakes that you've made.

911
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:09,048
You don't know anything about life.

912
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,134
How hard it is.

913
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:14,766
You're just...

914
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:16,979
Some spoiled girl

915
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,190
who breaks their toys

916
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,061
when mommy says she has to pick up.

917
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:27,362
Sorry. Pardon me, I don't mean
to interrupt what's, uh, going on here.

918
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,113
But you wouldn't happen to have seen

919
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:32,196
a tiny white prick with a pair of glasses
come through here, have you?

920
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:36,416
No.

921
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:39,463
What about a silver case with a train
sticker by the handle? You seen that?

922
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,254
It's not ringing any...

923
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:44,879
Uncle Kimura, have you seen
a silver briefcase with the train...

924
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,257
Did you say "train sticker by the handle"?

925
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,261
- The handle had a train sticker.
- That's unique.

926
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,849
No, I haven't seen anything like that.
I think I'd remember.

927
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:52,935
Hm.

928
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:55,097
"Uncle Kimura"?

929
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:58,602
- Yeah.
- Right. Are you okay? That's...

930
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:01,605
Oh, yeah. Never shave on a bullet train,
you know what they say.

931
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:05,404
Well, couldn't hurt to ask, you know?
I'm just gonna keep following him.

932
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,106
Pardon me, "Uncle Kimura."

933
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,361
You guys take care.

934
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,283
Just one thing, though, uh...

935
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:15,331
Most people assume "suitcase,"
you know, 'cause it's a train,

936
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:16,623
overnight and all.

937
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,460
But you...

938
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,293
You said "briefcase."

939
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,704
I never said "briefcase."

940
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,668
I think...

941
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,588
I found my diesel.

942
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:35,475
- You know what's waiting for us in Kyoto.
- Mm-hm.

943
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:39,017
We should just get off this train. Now.

944
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:42,314
If you think I'm stepping off this train
without Lemon or the case,

945
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,319
you must be mistaken.

946
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,819
Okay. Well, the case is
in the first-class lounge.

947
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:49,148
It's behind the bar.
It's in a trash can. It's yours.

948
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,028
Me, I'm getting off.

949
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,450
I'm gonna go find a temple and 
reevaluate my choices or something.

950
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,787
Ooh, that sounds very lovely,
but here's the deal.

951
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:57,581
I still need a fall guy.

952
01:03:58,418 --> 01:03:59,533
Shit.

953
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,160
- You need a fall guy.
- Yeah.

954
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,292
No, I understand. I get it.

955
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,633
It's a bit of a conundrum, 'cause I'm thinking,

956
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,256
"do I hand him back in one piece"

957
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:13,681
or do I chop you up into little pieces
and stuff you inside a fucking Momomon.

958
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,724
That's what's going through my head right now.

959
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,810
Hm.

960
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:18,643
Or...

961
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:20,437
Or what? You got a better idea, do ya?

962
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,432
You know, before us now is just a wall,

963
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,733
but it's an illusion, man, it's a construct.

964
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,482
You know, 'cause within that wall sits a window.

965
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:30,109
A window of opportunity.

966
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:31,819
Damn it. It's a door.

967
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,368
Within that wall is a door.

968
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:37,787
I'm finding it very hard to follow this story.

969
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,740
My point is, that door is closing.

970
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,009
Now the only question is:

971
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,137
Which one is the diesel, which one is the duck?

972
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,308
"The duck"?

973
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:01,012
It's a kid's show. "Thomas the train engine."

974
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:03,723
Close. <i>Thomas the tank engine.</i>

975
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:04,978
Please, mister.

976
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:07,601
This man, he kidnapped me,

977
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:10,778
and he said that he's going
to hold me for ransom.

978
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,780
I'm sorry.
I get captivated by white-girl tears.

979
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:16,701
Bravo.

980
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:20,201
Common sense tells me that this old,
shaky geezer here is the one in charge,

981
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,873
but I'm really good at reading people

982
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,497
and something tells me
that you are just not fucking right.

983
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:31,884
So... let's see here.
I mean, I can't shoot you both.

984
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:34,886
Then I get no answers.

985
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:39,095
How about this? I'm sure you'll love this.
We're gonna play a little game.

986
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,517
If you wanna play a game, put both your hands up.

987
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,186
Perfect. I knew you would like this.

988
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:46,186
You're gonna close your eyes,
and I'm gonna count to three.

989
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,481
Whichever one is in charge, raise your hand.

990
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,446
Whichever one isn't, you point at the one who is.

991
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:53,069
Now if you both raise your hands
or you both point at each other,

992
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,988
I know you're both liars,
and the truth ain't in ya.

993
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:56,859
And then I'll fucking shoot you both.
Ready?

994
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,991
You said you couldn't kill us both.
You'd get no answers.

995
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:02,288
- I did say that. Didn't I?
- Yes.

996
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:06,414
Sometimes you gotta shoot first
and come up with answers later.

997
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:08,166
One.

998
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,837
<i>Or if I don't answer this phone when you call...</i>

999
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:13,459
- Two. Three.
- <i>Kill Wataru.</i>

1000
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,246
Am I dreaming?

1001
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,982
Sorry, mate. Not your lucky day.

1002
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,282
I have a wire in my bag,

1003
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:27,367
and I think that we could use it
to lock the door from the outside.

1004
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,334
It was so scary.

1005
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:34,710
He said that if I didn't do what he said,
or if I yelled or anything,

1006
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:36,917
that he would do awful, awful things to me.

1007
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,718
Then why didn't you use this, then?

1008
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:46,559
Yeah, he kidnapped ya and, uh, 
gave you his gun to hold, right?

1009
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,512
- No, no, no. Um...
- Easy.

1010
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:51,849
Please. I don't know how to use a gun.
I don't know. Please.

1011
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:53,525
Fuck me. You are fucking...

1012
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:56,023
You are really good.
You sure you didn't study?

1013
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:58,105
You're not even afraid and your lip's quivering.

1014
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,782
That's a tear.
That is really authentic, mate.

1015
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:01,868
You're the diesel.

1016
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,985
- I gotta kill ya.
- Please.

1017
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,320
I'm just a kid. Please.

1018
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:08,282
How do you do that?!
It's really unbelievable!

1019
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:09,457
Please. Please.

1020
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,219
I got, uh...

1021
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:22,508
It's fucking... you stay right there.

1022
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:25,348
Did you...? What the fuck is happening?

1023
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,556
Everyone loves lemons.

1024
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:39,775
Fucking die!

1025
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:54,294
I'm glad you enjoyed the performance.

1026
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,126
How did you do that?

1027
01:08:58,343 --> 01:08:59,799
I'm not sure.

1028
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,593
Just lucky, I guess.

1029
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,639
Tell Tangerine... tell Tangerine...

1030
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:09,642
Tangerine...

1031
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:11,605
He's Gordon.

1032
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,230
Tangerine is Gordon.

1033
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:25,029
Getting off this train.
I'm getting that case, and that's it.

1034
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:34,211
Hello?

1035
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:36,828
<i>Yuichi.</i>

1036
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:41,333
Uh, it looks like Yuichi lost 
his phone on the bullet train.

1037
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,187
You can pick it up at Kyoto station, though.

1038
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:45,048
- <i>Kyoto?</i>
- There's this find my phone app.

1039
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:46,925
Oh.

1040
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,131
Surprisingly accurate.

1041
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:49,261
<i>Bye.</i>

1042
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,115
God, he's got a great walk.

1043
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:19,332
Mr. Wolf.

1044
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,131
So you came to kill The Hornet.

1045
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:32,134
What happened?

1046
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:36,721
Are you okay?

1047
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:41,726
Fuck, that thing is hot.

1048
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:51,779
Momomomo. Momomon. Momon. Momomon.

1049
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,756
The pastry chef.

1050
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:18,940
Oh.

1051
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,392
You stole my snake, bitch.

1052
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:26,317
That was your...? We should really
call the authorities 'cause someone...

1053
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,487
Take that, punk!

1054
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:40,373
Hey, bitch. One little prick from this,
you know what happens?

1055
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:43,376
- Yes.
- Your blood congeals, clogging your veins.

1056
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:46,208
- You bleed out of your fucking eye socket.
- I said yes!

1057
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:49,469
Weak-ass bitch.

1058
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,923
- Stop!
- I'm taking that case.

1059
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:54,098
Give it!

1060
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:56,347
I was promised my money.

1061
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:59,513
- By who?
- Don't know. It was all online.

1062
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:01,518
They said my money was in the case.

1063
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:05,477
What? Someone paid you to have
the kid killed with his own ransom?

1064
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:07,027
Wow. That's dark.

1065
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,025
That is dark as... stop!

1066
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,903
The Hornet stings, bitch!

1067
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:17,413
Lady, you can have the case.

1068
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,867
Oh, but you've seen my face, bitch.

1069
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,762
Thirty seconds before the venom does its thing.

1070
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,654
- Oh.
- You bitch.

1071
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:56,907
Oh, shit, man. Do you have a backup?

1072
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:59,114
What do you think, bitch?

1073
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:02,997
Oh, shit, man.

1074
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:06,375
You don't have another one?

1075
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:08,297
You gotta be better prepared.

1076
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:11,217
I'm mansplaining,
I'm mansplaining again. I'm sorry.

1077
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:12,304
Uh...

1078
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:15,096
Can I get you something?

1079
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:16,182
Uh...

1080
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,060
Uh...

1081
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:23,388
You don't seem like a religious person.

1082
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,816
Water? Would you like some water?

1083
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:30,069
No?

1084
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,443
You want a blanket?

1085
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,444
You want me to hold your hand?

1086
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:46,707

Your son's a complete bellend

And as for your case,
I haven't seen it since Tokyo.

He was wearing glasses, and he killed my uncle.

he just kept talking about
Thomas the trains and...

Yeah, right. Exactly.

01:18:58,442 --> 01:18:59,728
But he killed both of them,

1160
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:03,607
and then he said he was going to get away
with some sort of money. I don't know.

1164
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:18,327

that I could be a good backup plan

1165
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,787

1166

01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:10,488
He said that he was going to kill you
and blame everything on you.

1199
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:16,069
He also said that there's someone
waiting for us at Kyoto station.

1200
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,910
Someone scary, who would hurt me.

1201
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:22,541
No one's gonna hurt you.

1202
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:24,459
It's okay.

1203
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:26,787
We're getting off this train.

1204
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:37,715
We make the next stop, we'll be fine.

1205
01:21:57,996 --> 01:22:00,154
Okay, kid, come
0... kid, come on!

1206
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,619
I can't, my backpack is stuck!

1207
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:03,744
What?

1208
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:05,785
Leave it, let's go.

1209
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:07,665
- We gotta go, we gotta go.
- No, I can't!

1210
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,042
Right now, young lady!

1211
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:11,090
- No!
- It's our last chance!

1212
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:12,382
Please come back!

1213
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:13,755
Kid, please.

1214
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:16,713
I'm scared, I don't want to be alone, please!

1215
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:23,477
I got it.

1216
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:26,056
It's not your fault, kid.

1217
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,482
It's my luck, not yours.

1218
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:32,732
You got your whole life ahead of you.

1219
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:36,111
Make sure you do something that brings you peace.

1220
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:39,572
'Cause everything else is a pain in the ass.

1221
01:22:40,414 --> 01:22:43,998
And if you run into a guy named Carver.
He's a dick!

1222
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,700
You can tell him I said so.

1223
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:48,629
Um...

1224
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:51,466
I, uh...

1225
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,092
I took this. I didn't want to leave it.

1226
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:58,383
The man had it, and I thought 
you could probably use it

1227
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:01,307
to kill whoever's waiting
for us at the end of the line.

1228
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:04,018
You're not going to let me get hurt.

1229
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:05,515
Be honest.

1230
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:08,316
Be honest.

1231
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:09,769
Who's there with you?

1232
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:16,824
Really?

1233
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:18,990
Right. Uh...

1234
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:21,569
Okay, fella, you're creepin' me out.

1235
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:25,782
So, if you don't mind,
could you just find another seat, like,

1236
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:29,210
way, way, way down there?

1237
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:33,210
And that way, I won't have to tell you twice.

1238
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:34,967
No.

1239
01:23:35,636 --> 01:23:36,842
You won't.

1240
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:44,805
Let's just move.
Let me grab your bag.

1241
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:47,637
Ow.

1242
01:23:57,950 --> 01:23:59,190
Was that a snake?

1243
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:01,025
Would you know where my son is?

1244
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:07,118
Ow! Ow! Ow!

1245
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:23,346
Oh, fuck.

1246
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:34,563
Wow.

1247
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:36,644
After everything.

1248
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:44,910
You are the person

1249
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:48,998
who pushed my grandson
off the department store roof.

1250
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,199
Why?

1251
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:51,409
Your son.

1252
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:55,584
He was going to help me kill the 
White Death at Kyoto station.

1253
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:59,295
And that was the only way
to get him on this train.

1254
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:03,928
The White Death.

1255
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:05,472
That's right.

1256
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:07,926
But he couldn't even do that.

1257
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:10,605
So he's dead.

1258
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:12,846
Just a few cars back.

1259
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:14,974
They are both dead.

1260
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:25,617
My grandson was pushed off a roof.

1261
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:29,743
What makes you think
I would leave him unprotected?

1262
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:55,730
My grandson is safe.

1263
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:58,900
And my son is not dead.

1264
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:01,646
Listen, old man...

1265
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:04,482
The only thing you know
about an old man, young lady,

1266
01:26:05,202 --> 01:26:07,660
is that he has survived much more,

1267
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:11,364
and much worse, than you.

1268
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:22,341
I'll fucking kill him myself.

1269
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:33,394
- Are you all right?
- From that?

1270
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:37,519
You're not gonna believe this coincidence

1271
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:42,103
but I already got a dose of antivenom
in me today, so I'm good.

1272
01:26:43,407 --> 01:26:44,647
Probably.

1273
01:26:46,993 --> 01:26:47,993
The girl...

1274
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:50,778
Her intentions with you were not honorable.

1275
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:52,579
Yeah.

1276
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:56,000
A blind man could see
you are the one in the dark.

1277
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:58,999
I don't know about a blind man.
She was pretty convincing.

1278
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:02,589
- What did you do to her?
- I did not need to do anything.

1279
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:06,798
Fate will do what it wills.

1280
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:10,805
Why do you laugh at fate?

1281
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:17,017
Man, fate for me is just 
another word for bad luck.

1282
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:22,769
And that follows me around like...

1283
01:27:25,115 --> 01:27:26,981
I don't know, something witty.

1284
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:32,619
My handler calls me ladybug.

1285
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:34,613
She's witty.

1286
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:36,039
Ladybug?

1287
01:27:36,126 --> 01:27:36,957
Yeah.

1288
01:27:37,043 --> 01:27:39,580
This is very lucky, indeed.

1289
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:43,414
No, she's being ironic, she...

1290
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,169
Ah, never mind.

1291
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,297
I'm going to tell you a story now.

1292
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:49,048
- No, I'm good.
- It's short.

1293
01:27:49,723 --> 01:27:50,633
Really, I'm fine.

1294
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:52,886
No, it's very quick.

1295
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:54,512
No, no.

1296
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:56,844
It's a good story for you, I think.

1297
01:27:57,481 --> 01:27:58,346
I'm cool.

1298
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,475
Here we go.

1299
01:28:01,485 --> 01:28:02,850
A long time ago,

1300
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:05,398
I made a promise to myself

1301
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:11,447
<i>that I would provide for my family
no matter what it cost.</i>

1302
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:20,076
<i>I had risen to a highly coveted position
within the Minegishi crime family.</i>

1303
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,953
A man raised up to take my place.

1304
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:24,959
<i>A man from the north.</i>

1305
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:34,598
<i>I asked Minegishi not to trust this man.</i>

1306
01:28:35,519 --> 01:28:39,558
<i>Minegishi told me I had lost my appetite.</i>

1307
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:40,648
<i>He was not wrong.</i>

1308
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:43,227
<i>But neither was I.</i>

1309
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:07,293
<i>I returned home</i>

1310
01:29:07,384 --> 01:29:11,969
and found nothing except ash and blood.

1311
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:33,239
<i>The White Death had taken everything from me.</i>

1312
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:35,067
Almost.

1313
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:39,621
Yuichi!

1314
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:42,158
Yuichi.

1315
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:48,418
<i>I went into hiding.</i>

1316
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:52,380
<i>I searched for a way to strike at the White Death</i>

1317
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:55,132
<i>without endangering what I had left.</i>

1318
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:58,094
But he remained forever out of reach.

1319
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:01,222
I did not think

1320
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:04,931
fate would ever give me
a chance to make things right.

1321
01:30:07,027 --> 01:30:09,985
Do you know what they call a ladybug in Japan?

1322
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:12,406
Uh-uh.

1323
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:14,277
<i>Tentoumushi.</i>

1324
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:18,987
As a boy, I was told there is a spot on its back

1325
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,538
for each of the seven sorrows of the world.

1326
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:25,751
You see, <i>Tentoumushi</i> is not lucky.

1327
01:30:26,296 --> 01:30:31,336
It holds all the bad luck so 
that others may live in peace.

1328
01:30:34,304 --> 01:30:36,716
I don't wanna hold the seven sorrows.

1329
01:30:36,806 --> 01:30:40,765
Everything that's ever happened 
to you has led you here.

1330
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:43,555
Fate.

1331
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:46,021
Well, that's a shit deal.

1332
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:49,312
At Kyoto station,

1333
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:52,944
the White Death will arrive on this train.

1334
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:56,982
I will finally be allowed to make things right.

1335
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:00,660
My son is a few cars up.

1336
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:03,409
If you could escort him off this train...

1337
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:08,828
Yeah, I don't see the White Death
letting any of us off this train.

1338
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:12,797
You let me worry about the White Death.

1339
01:31:15,512 --> 01:31:16,512
Okay.

1340
01:31:19,516 --> 01:31:20,802
Mr. Ladybug?

1341
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:25,928
- Your briefcase.
- Thank you.

1342
01:31:37,784 --> 01:31:38,865
Father.

1343
01:31:40,704 --> 01:31:41,739
I don't understand.

1344
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:44,746
It is fate, my son.

1345
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:46,581
And Wataru?

1346
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:47,874
He is safe.

1347
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:52,256
Well...

1348
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:54,460
He seemed like a decent guy.

1349
01:31:55,885 --> 01:31:56,920
He shot me.

1350
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:58,512
Me, too.

1351
01:31:58,555 --> 01:31:59,555
Twice.

1352
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:01,930
Still, he had another side to him...

1353
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:05,600
Wow.

1354
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:10,597
Oh, man.

1355
01:32:11,985 --> 01:32:13,066
Am I in Hell?

1356
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:17,604
Ah, fuck.

1357
01:32:21,745 --> 01:32:23,110
Fuckin' vest, man.

1358
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:26,909
Oh, you drank the water.

1359
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,044
Where the fuck is my brother?

01:33:56,798 --> 01:34:02,293
♫ <i>from my home...</i> ♫

1374
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:03,593
Fellas.

1375
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:06,092
We need to come up with a plan.

1376
01:34:06,182 --> 01:34:10,096
You killed my brother.
You killed my brother, you piece of shit!

1377
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:12,518
Yeah, you fucking shot me!

1378
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:14,435
I'll shoot you in the fucking throat next time

1379
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:16,306
and your fucking partner Keira Knightley!

1380
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:18,358
- She is not my...
- Hey! Fellas!

1381
01:34:18,444 --> 01:34:21,527
When we are so quick to anger,
we are slow to understand.

1382
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:23,574
I'm fast to kick your ass, though,
I swear to God.

1383
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:28,284
Fucking piece of shit! I shoulda
put a bullet through your fucking ass!

1384
01:34:28,371 --> 01:34:30,658
When you point a finger at someone in blame,

1385
01:34:30,748 --> 01:34:32,785
there are four fingers pointing back at you.

1386
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:35,742
Or three. That's weird.

1387
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:38,124
Fuck it! That's it!
You know what I could do!

1388
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:40,581
- We before me!
- You before fucking God...

1389
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:41,710
Gentlemen!

1390
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:43,802
Get off me!

1391
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:49,841
A plum does not resent the hungry man,
but the farmer who planted the tree.

1392
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:54,018
He resents the farmer?

1393
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:56,938
So how do plums have fuckin' resentments?
So how can it resent?

1394
01:34:57,025 --> 01:34:59,858
Listen. The White Death is the farmer.

1395
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:04,396
So we're the plums. We're the plums?

1396
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:06,982
It don't make sense.
Why are you motherfuckers using metaphors?

1397
01:35:07,076 --> 01:35:08,658
Look, he shot my fucking brother!

1398
01:35:08,745 --> 01:35:10,361
You shot my son!

1399
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:15,999
We prepare together...

1400
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:18,497
Or we die alone.

1401
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:22,001
That's all I was trying to say.

1402
01:35:25,803 --> 01:35:30,468
<i>The White Death waits for you
with his Army of assassins.</i>

1403
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:33,175
<i>Killers from all countries.</i>

1404
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:39,098
<i>But he has no idea my son 
and I are on this train.</i>

1405
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:41,141
<i>If fate wills,</i>

1406
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:43,852
<i>I will get my revenge.</i>

1407
01:35:45,448 --> 01:35:48,941
<i>I'll head to the back and stop as many as I can.</i>

1408
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:53,032
<i>I'll go to the driver car
and get us the fuck out of here.</i>

1409
01:35:58,086 --> 01:36:00,703
What are you gonna do, Joburg?

1410
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,205
I'm gonna buy us some time.

1411
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:03,439
Daughter.

1412
01:37:05,194 --> 01:37:06,355
Father.

1413
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:17,450
Hey, uh, fellas,
I'm looking for a Mr. Death.

1414
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:19,030
Got his case here.

1415
01:37:19,792 --> 01:37:21,203
Hey, easy.

1416
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:31,126
Hurt people hurt people.

1417
01:37:38,144 --> 01:37:39,509
I came to see you.

1418
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:41,561
Hm.

1419
01:37:41,647 --> 01:37:44,105
And to make you finally see me.

1420
01:37:46,027 --> 01:37:47,563
The real me.

1421
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:50,312
Hm.

1422
01:37:50,406 --> 01:37:54,115
I built myself up from the nothing you gave me.

1423
01:37:54,202 --> 01:37:57,035
All so I could be the one 
in front of you today...

1424
01:37:57,997 --> 01:37:59,579
My finger on the trigger.

1425
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:03,412
I was the one...

1426
01:38:04,545 --> 01:38:06,456
Who deserved your attention.

1427
01:38:10,676 --> 01:38:11,837
Your love.

1428
01:38:12,845 --> 01:38:16,463
I'm more like you than that 
little fuckup ever was.

1429
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:31,774
Do it.

1430
01:38:34,242 --> 01:38:35,653
I came here to kill you.

1431
01:38:38,037 --> 01:38:39,402
So kill me.

1432
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:44,491
Kill me like you did all 
the others who tried the same.

1433
01:38:56,055 --> 01:38:57,136
Do it.

1434
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:04,810
Fucking do it!

1435
01:39:10,695 --> 01:39:12,402
Pow.

1436
01:39:18,494 --> 01:39:20,110
I see you, <i>Dochka.</i>

1437
01:39:21,372 --> 01:39:23,283
I always have.

1438
01:39:25,668 --> 01:39:29,457
But you have never been part of my plan.

1439
01:39:35,511 --> 01:39:37,001
We found the American!

1440
01:39:40,099 --> 01:39:41,499
What about the others?

1441
01:39:41,559 --> 01:39:42,890
They're all dead.

1442
01:39:43,519 --> 01:39:46,477
Uh, good news is I have your case.

1443
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:50,057
Ay, good news, good news.

1444
01:39:50,151 --> 01:39:51,858
Check the case.

1445
01:39:51,944 --> 01:39:54,356
Hurry. Move. Let's go.

1446
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:57,230
Clear the train.

1447
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:02,945
All right, Thomas.
Time for you to start up...

1448
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:05,531
Oh, shit. Everything's in Japanese.

1449
01:40:05,625 --> 01:40:07,536
There is no episode in Japanese.
What the f...?

1450
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:13,375
Get on the ground!

1451
01:40:20,473 --> 01:40:24,137
Man, I got a bad feeling about this.
We have no idea what's in this case.

1452
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:25,307
What are you talkin' about?

1453
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:27,811
Why is it always gotta be us
that opens this shit?

1454
01:40:27,897 --> 01:40:29,558
Just open the goddamn case.

1455
01:40:29,649 --> 01:40:31,390
I'd like to keep my fuckin' arms.

1456
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:34,518
Uh, Mr. Death, if I may?

1457
01:40:35,738 --> 01:40:37,649
The shadow buyer

1458
01:40:38,324 --> 01:40:41,942
<i>who bought all our contracts,
got us all on this train.</i>

1459
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:44,569
<i>Me, The Hornet,</i> Tangerine, Lemon...

1460
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:47,780
Om that was you, right?

1461
01:40:48,834 --> 01:40:51,075
Yes, very astute.

1462
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:53,958
I brought you on this train
hoping you'd kill each other.

1463
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:55,630
Okay. Well, um...

1464
01:40:57,009 --> 01:40:59,626
If I could... why?

1465
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:02,052
Why you do what you do?

1466
01:41:02,139 --> 01:41:04,847
You know, I've been asking that very question.

1467
01:41:04,934 --> 01:41:07,301
If it's so safe, why didn't he just open it?

1468
01:41:07,395 --> 01:41:09,762
What if it's a bomb and it blows up in our faces?

1469
01:41:09,855 --> 01:41:12,267
You think these stupid masks
are gonna protect us?

1470
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:19,792
All these years later...

1471
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:24,280
The burden of your betrayal
still heavy upon your heads.

1472
01:41:26,622 --> 01:41:28,989
Let me relieve you of both.

1473
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:31,370
My wife...

1474
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:34,084
Was taken from me.

1475
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:41,877
I heard. I'm so sorry for your loss.
It was a horrible accident.

1476
01:41:43,973 --> 01:41:45,759
- Horrible.
- Oh, no.

1477
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:49,388
No. Nothing in life is an accident.

1478
01:41:49,979 --> 01:41:52,937
It was an assassination attempt on me.

1479
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,024
But fate...

1480
01:41:55,901 --> 01:41:59,269
Fate put two wet work operatives,

1481
01:41:59,864 --> 01:42:03,323
<i>twins, on a job in Bolivia,</i>

1482
01:42:04,785 --> 01:42:07,743
<i>butchering my entire crew.</i>

1483
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:10,572
And I had to go deal with it.

1484
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:13,078
And he didn't hire two random operators, Lemon.

1485
01:42:13,169 --> 01:42:15,536
No, he asked for the two
responsible for the Bolivia job.

1486
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:20,750
That is why it was my wife in the car that night,

1487
01:42:21,344 --> 01:42:22,344
not me.

1488
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:25,886
Fate put my wife in the hospital.

1489
01:42:26,641 --> 01:42:28,473
A piece of her rib

1490
01:42:29,352 --> 01:42:31,389
piercing her heart.

1491
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:38,934
Only the most skilled cardiovascular
surgeon could save her life.

1492
01:42:41,322 --> 01:42:46,283
But two nights earlier,
this surgeon was poisoned.

1493
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,861
Oh, my God!

1494
01:42:49,955 --> 01:42:53,368
Fate. Fate again.

1495
01:42:53,459 --> 01:42:54,949
They said my money was in the case!

1496
01:42:55,753 --> 01:42:59,417
Don't wanna sound judgmental,
but if you hired The Hornet,

1497
01:42:59,507 --> 01:43:01,669
you had your own kid killed?

1498
01:43:01,759 --> 01:43:03,466
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.

1499
01:43:03,552 --> 01:43:05,793
Oh, yes, I did. The piece of shit.

1500
01:43:06,347 --> 01:43:07,347
Please, please.

1501
01:43:07,431 --> 01:43:08,431
<i>That night...</i>

1502
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:11,842
- Please pick me up.
- <i>I told her not to leave.</i>

1503
01:43:12,895 --> 01:43:14,135
<i>To wait for me.</i>

1504
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:19,775
<i>But she promised it was the last time
we would ever bail him out of trouble.</i>

1505
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:22,272
I will come. I will always come for you.

1506
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:26,485
Well, I suppose she was right.

1507
01:43:27,243 --> 01:43:30,736
If I had amputated that weakness

1508
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:33,412
out of my life years ago,

1509
01:43:33,499 --> 01:43:36,241
she would still be by my side!

1510
01:43:36,877 --> 01:43:39,995
Yeah, it helps to process this.
I have a good therapist.

1511
01:43:40,089 --> 01:43:41,955
I loved my wife very much.

1512
01:43:43,342 --> 01:43:45,208
She taught me a valuable lesson.

1513
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:48,002
If you do not control your fate...

1514
01:43:49,348 --> 01:43:50,554
It will control you.

1515
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:52,177
Hm. Hm?

1516
01:43:52,268 --> 01:43:54,555
So I took control.

1517
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:56,431
I brought them all here to die.

1518
01:44:01,277 --> 01:44:04,486
<i>But now there is only one left.</i>

1519
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:08,523
Mr. Carver.

1520
01:44:08,617 --> 01:44:11,526
Whoa. Uh... excuse me?

1521
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:13,577
I'm filling in for Carver?
Calling in sick?

1522
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:14,950
Fuck Carver.

1523
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:17,498
The man who murdered my wife.

1524
01:44:23,924 --> 01:44:24,755
Bro.

1525
01:44:24,842 --> 01:44:27,334
- Just open it!
- Fine. Ya happy?

1526
01:44:27,428 --> 01:44:28,428
I'm not Carver!

1527
01:44:45,362 --> 01:44:46,362
He went that way.

1528
01:44:55,498 --> 01:44:57,114
Oh, shit. Okay.

1529
01:44:58,167 --> 01:44:59,828
Oh, shit. Something's happening.

1530
01:45:28,447 --> 01:45:29,778
Excuse me.

1531
01:45:31,158 --> 01:45:32,158
Yep.

1532
01:46:13,367 --> 01:46:14,857
Kimura.

1533
01:46:15,703 --> 01:46:16,703
Why are you here?

1534
01:46:17,621 --> 01:46:18,827
Your daughter.

1535
01:46:18,914 --> 01:46:20,780
It would seem she pushed...

1536
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:23,537
The wrong grandson off a roof.

1537
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:30,582
Ah, children. You do
the best you can to raise them right.

1538
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:34,218
Cockroach, I do not know why you are here,

1539
01:46:34,305 --> 01:46:37,548
but move out of my way
or you will join your wife.

1540
01:46:38,183 --> 01:46:41,266
Our paths were destined to return to each other.

1541
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:45,398
Okay.

1542
01:46:45,816 --> 01:46:49,025
Wait. Fuckin' slow down, mate. Come on!

1543
01:46:49,111 --> 01:46:51,853
Hey, so far so good.
You can stop the train.

1544
01:46:51,947 --> 01:46:55,190
About that. I took the velocity
of the train and divided it by the mass,

1545
01:46:55,284 --> 01:46:58,151
and I realized that I don't know how
to fuckin' drive a bullet train.

1546
01:46:58,245 --> 01:46:59,986
Dude, all you do is talk about trains.

1547
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:02,412
Thomas is a metaphor for life,
not how to actually drive...

1548
01:47:02,499 --> 01:47:03,830
Get down!

1549
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:31,854
Shit.

1550
01:47:39,495 --> 01:47:41,452
I got this! Stop the train!

1551
01:47:41,538 --> 01:47:42,744
What?!

1552
01:48:34,425 --> 01:48:35,825
English, English, English, English.

1553
01:48:36,468 --> 01:48:38,175
English. Brakes!

1554
01:48:38,262 --> 01:48:40,378
We're good! I got it!

1555
01:48:41,807 --> 01:48:42,807
No!

1556
01:48:45,728 --> 01:48:47,935
- Hold on!
- We're on the wrong track!

1557
01:49:02,786 --> 01:49:04,322
- Oi, Joburg!
- What?

1558
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:08,872
I'm sorry I shot you!

1559
01:49:08,959 --> 01:49:11,041
Actually it was, like, twice!

1560
01:49:12,004 --> 01:49:13,119
Oh.

1561
01:49:15,132 --> 01:49:16,042
Sorry?

1562
01:49:16,133 --> 01:49:18,090
You shot me twice!

1563
01:49:29,938 --> 01:49:31,269
I'm sorry I shot you twice.

1564
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:34,400
Thanks, man!

1565
01:49:35,152 --> 01:49:36,517
That shows real growth!

1566
01:49:40,866 --> 01:49:43,278
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck.

1567
01:49:52,669 --> 01:49:54,330
You are not ruled by strength.

1568
01:49:54,421 --> 01:49:55,752
You are ruled by fear!

1569
01:49:56,715 --> 01:49:59,332
Fear of the one thing
deep down you cannot control!

1570
01:50:07,142 --> 01:50:08,553
Fear of fate!

1571
01:50:16,902 --> 01:50:19,894
Hey, and I'm sorry about Tangerine.

1572
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:22,275
Yeah.

1573
01:50:23,492 --> 01:50:24,492
Yeah.

1574
01:50:25,911 --> 01:50:27,367
But I got another brother now.

1575
01:50:27,955 --> 01:50:28,955
Really?

1576
01:50:31,792 --> 01:50:32,792
Fuck no!

1577
01:50:57,025 --> 01:50:58,732
For old times' sake.

1578
01:51:40,235 --> 01:51:41,316
Fuck it.

1579
01:52:05,427 --> 01:52:07,009
$♫%♫

1580
01:52:12,017 --> 01:52:13,553
B-20.

1581
01:52:14,978 --> 01:52:15,978
Let's go.

1582
01:52:18,398 --> 01:52:19,980
- Oh, mate.
- Yeah?

1583
01:52:20,484 --> 01:52:21,849
I wanted bubble milk tea.

1584
01:52:21,944 --> 01:52:23,150
How about a wagon wheel?

1585
01:52:53,392 --> 01:52:54,598
A father...

1586
01:52:55,227 --> 01:52:56,262
Protects his family.

1587
01:54:13,597 --> 01:54:14,597
Huh.

1588
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:31,858
Oh, fuck.

1589
01:54:35,243 --> 01:54:38,326
About your wife, I had nothing to do with that.

1590
01:54:39,081 --> 01:54:40,162
It's a mistake.

1591
01:54:40,248 --> 01:54:41,955
I'm not Carver.

1592
01:54:43,335 --> 01:54:45,793
I only do snatch-and-grab jobs.

1593
01:54:46,421 --> 01:54:49,755
The Carver! I want the Carver!
I hired the Carver!

1594
01:54:49,841 --> 01:54:52,299
No, he had a stomach thing, man.

1595
01:54:52,386 --> 01:54:53,922
I'm just filling in.

1596
01:54:58,683 --> 01:55:00,094
You're filling in.

1597
01:55:00,185 --> 01:55:03,143
For what it's worth, Carver is a dick.

1598
01:55:03,230 --> 01:55:05,221
The most cunning assassin...?

1599
01:55:05,774 --> 01:55:07,230
Maybe the laziest.

1600
01:55:16,701 --> 01:55:18,362
Aw, come on.

1601
01:55:19,287 --> 01:55:20,869
Just let it go, Bro.

1602
01:55:20,956 --> 01:55:23,789
Do not call me "Bro"!

1603
01:55:25,377 --> 01:55:26,458
Okay.

1604
01:55:36,346 --> 01:55:37,346
Oh...

1605
01:55:39,933 --> 01:55:40,933
Ugh.

1606
01:55:42,436 --> 01:55:43,597
Dude, did you see that?

1607
01:55:44,521 --> 01:55:45,521
What was that?

1608
01:55:52,112 --> 01:55:53,147
Dude.

1609
01:55:55,073 --> 01:55:56,279
It's done.

1610
01:56:09,212 --> 01:56:13,456
Hey, about this plum. Shouldn't the plum
give up all resentment? Like...

1611
01:56:15,927 --> 01:56:17,417
Oh, my God.

1612
01:56:17,512 --> 01:56:22,757
It's my luck that delivered
my father's corpse at my feet.

1613
01:56:22,851 --> 01:56:25,388
The narcissism on this chick.

1614
01:56:25,479 --> 01:56:26,514
Untreatable.

1615
01:56:26,605 --> 01:56:30,055
Now I am... okay,
wait, wait, wait.

1616
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:31,060
What?

1617
01:56:31,151 --> 01:56:33,563
What is with this fucked-up family?

1618
01:56:34,488 --> 01:56:36,775
You need some suggested reading, if I may.

1619
01:56:37,407 --> 01:56:39,273
<i>Surviving borderline personality disorder.</i>

1620
01:56:39,367 --> 01:56:40,367
What?

1621
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:41,525
I highly recommend it.

1622
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:44,658
Now I am the White D...

1623
01:56:47,751 --> 01:56:48,751
What was that?

1624
01:56:52,464 --> 01:56:53,829
Was that Karma?

1625
01:56:53,924 --> 01:56:56,541
Farewell, <i>Tentoumushi.</i>

1626
01:56:59,137 --> 01:57:00,218
Tangerine.

1627
01:57:03,725 --> 01:57:04,725
Wow.

1628
01:57:17,864 --> 01:57:18,945
Maria?

1629
01:57:19,032 --> 01:57:20,113
Take the gun.

1630
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:21,782
Oh, my God, did you just say "whack"?

1631
01:57:21,868 --> 01:57:24,326
We're almost there.
You just need to get up.

1632
01:57:24,412 --> 01:57:26,119
Did you come to rescue me?

1633
01:57:27,123 --> 01:57:28,488
Did you need rescuing?

1634
01:57:28,583 --> 01:57:30,244
You came to rescue me.

1635
01:57:30,335 --> 01:57:31,917
Please don't make me regret it.

1636
01:57:33,505 --> 01:57:37,749
Okay, don't. Don't. What's happening
to your face? Are you crying?

1637
01:57:37,842 --> 01:57:39,298
It's a lot to process.

1638
01:57:40,011 --> 01:57:42,969
I want you to know, you are the greatest,

1639
01:57:43,056 --> 01:57:45,718
most wonderful handler

1640
01:57:45,809 --> 01:57:48,676
that I could ever have. Ever. Ever.

1641
01:57:48,770 --> 01:57:51,933
Hm. Do you think maybe
there was a little head trauma?

1642
01:57:52,023 --> 01:57:53,764
- Maybe.
- Little bit, yeah.

1643
01:57:53,858 --> 01:57:56,225
- A little lightheaded.
- Yeah. Need a banana?

1644
01:57:56,319 --> 01:57:58,481
- Potassium might be good.
- Have one in the car.

1645
01:57:59,114 --> 01:57:59,945
Hey.

1646
01:58:00,031 --> 01:58:02,773
Next time, take the gun.
Don't listen to Barry.

1647
01:58:02,867 --> 01:58:04,699
Okay? Simple.

1648
01:58:07,330 --> 01:58:08,820
Stop it.

1649
01:58:08,915 --> 01:58:10,405
- Stop.
- You know,

1650
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:13,037
- I think you were right about one thing.
- Usually am. Come on.

1651
01:58:13,628 --> 01:58:15,915
Maybe it is just about how we frame it.

1652
01:58:16,006 --> 01:58:17,997
Like, maybe there's no bad luck or good luck.

1653
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:19,832
Maybe we're all just agents of fate.

1654
01:58:19,926 --> 01:58:20,926
Ooh!

1655
01:58:20,969 --> 01:58:22,505
- Nice car.
- Yes, it is.

1656
01:58:22,596 --> 01:58:23,757
Try not to bleed on it.

1657
01:58:30,937 --> 01:58:33,895
Holy mol... oh.

1658
01:58:35,859 --> 01:58:36,859
Well...

1659
01:58:38,737 --> 01:58:40,478
How do you know it's a bad thing?

1660
01:58:41,865 --> 01:58:42,865
Huh?

1661
01:58:42,907 --> 01:58:43,738
Really?

1662
01:58:43,825 --> 01:58:45,816
- See what I'm doing?
- I do.

1663
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:47,901
- Turning that upside down.
- I do.

1664
01:58:49,289 --> 01:58:50,289
This is working.

1665
01:58:50,665 --> 01:58:52,247

Well, maybe you've learned something after all.
